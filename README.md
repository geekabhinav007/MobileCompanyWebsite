## Working

The "Mobile Company Website" is a project that aims to provide users with a website where they can learn about mobile phones and even purchase them. The website includes features like user registration, login, contact form, and a fully functional database.

The website is built using a combination of technologies such as MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Here's an overview of each technology used:

- MongoDB: This is the database management system used to store and manage data related to mobile phones and user information.

- Express.js: This is a popular web application framework used to build web applications in Node.js.

- Node.js: This is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

- HTML: This is the standard markup language used to create web pages.

- CSS: This is the style sheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.

- Bootstrap: This is a popular front-end framework that simplifies the process of building responsive, mobile-first websites.

The website includes various pages such as Home, About Us, Contact Us, Products, and Registration. The Home page provides an overview of the website and highlights some of the latest mobile phones available. The About Us page provides information about the company and its mission. The Contact Us page allows users to get in touch with the company by filling out a form. The Products page displays all available mobile phones and allows users to purchase them by adding them to a shopping cart. Finally, the Registration page allows new users to register for an account, which is required to purchase products from the website.

To run the project, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. After cloning the repository, run the command "npm install" to install all the required dependencies listed in the package.json file. Then, you can start the server by running the command "npm start" or "nodemon server.js" if you have nodemon installed globally.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
